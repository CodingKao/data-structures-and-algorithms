# Code Challenge 30: Hash Tables

Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

- set
  - Arguments: key, value
  - Returns: nothing
  - This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
  - Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.

- get
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Value associated with that key in the table

- has
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

- keys
  - Returns: Collection of keys

- hash
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Index in the collection for that key

## Whiteboard Process

Not required for this code challenge.


## Approach & Efficiency
Followed along with Ryan during in-class implementation.  Worked on getting all the test to pass.
